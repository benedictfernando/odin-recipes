            Jollibee’s sweet style spaghetti sauce-now the tastiest and meatiest ever from Jollibee! With the chunkiest slices of savory ham and sausages, loaded with ground beef, served over premium quality noodles and topped with lots of cheese. Jollibee Spaghetti – the Spaghettiest!

            The legendary Jolly Spaghetti is a medley of spaghetti noodles, ground meat, sliced hot dogs, and a somewhat sweet sauce made from banana ketchup. It’s not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be, and it’s hearty and filling. I understand why this is a staple party food in the Philippines. It’s delicious, and the naysayers who disagree with banana ketchup don’t know what they’re talking about.
