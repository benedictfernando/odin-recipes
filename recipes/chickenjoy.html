        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The Best Fried Chicken! Crispylicious, Juicylicious! Jollibee’s perfectly seasoned fried chicken that’s crispy on the outside; tender and juicy on the inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chickenjoy is basically the Filipino counterpart to KFC's fried chicken buckets (but infinitely better). It’s delicious. The chicken comes out hot and perfectly battered, with a crunchy exterior and juicy interior. It’s well-seasoned and cooked just right—not dry like other fried chicken spots. It’s real chicken paired with silky and savory gravy (that accompanies the chicken), a perfect combination. It’s all in the name: Chickenjoy brings genuine joy.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 kilos chicken your choice cuts</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>cooking oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. five spice powder or ngohiong powder</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp. fine salt adjust if necessary</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the chicken pieces in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. Rub and press each chicken with the salt and pepper so all the pieces is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Next, to make the breading, in a mixing bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, five spice powder, garlic powder and salt.</li>
            <li>Stir the dry ingredients using a fork until all the ingredients are evenly mixed.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in the deep fryer or deep frying pan for about 175°C.</li>
            <li>Coat a piece of chicken with the breading inside and out. Coat underneath the skin as well.</li>
            <li>Do it by pressing each chicken with the breading then shake off excess breading and fry it.</li>
            <li>Depending on the size of your fryer and the size of your chicken, you can put 4 to 5 pieces per batch.</li>
            <li>Just don't overcrowd the fryer to avoid the fried chicken to become soggy and loose it's crispiness.</li>
            <li>Cook it for about 15 to 20 minutes in medium fire.</li>
            <li>Put the chicken in a paper towel or a rack to drain the excess oil.</li>
            <li>Serve with your favorite gravy. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
